              Fully closed-loop, automated machine learning engine. Given a certain business scenario, input the historical data of each variable of the scenario, and the variable engine can learn autonomously based on the historical data, dig out deep scene knowledge, and form a correlation map between the variables. Relying on the correlation map, customers can assign values to some variables, and the map can make real-time prediction of variables that have not been assigned values to achieve penetration of scene data / variable depth mining.

              Given the objects, resources, and business associations (a priori relationships or constraints between object attributes) of each scenario, a custom objective function (combined with the empirical evaluation value obtained from the attributes of each object) is used to evaluate the problem (Pros and cons of matching planning schemes), under the condition of satisfying business associations, find a matching planning scheme that optimizes the objective function. It is mainly divided into three major links: matching, distribution and planning.
